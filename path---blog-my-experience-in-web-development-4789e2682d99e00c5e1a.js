I had worked my way up to the \"store manager\" position and learned a tough lesson young. I knew that I needed to make a move, and school didn't seem like a possibility as I could barely afford rent. I applied for every job I could find from Craigslist. Honestly looking back I remember getting a phone interview for an \"entry level\" position, and I've never been so degraded in my life. I don't know why the tech field has such a prominent culture of \"punching down\" whenever possible.</p>\n<p>I digress.</p>\n<p>I got extremely lucky when a vendor offered me a temporary position in a production facility at Hewlett Packard (HP). It was at that job I met a friend who would introduce me to prograamming and unintentionally change my life. </p>\n<p>I feel the need to give a bit of back story in order to really continue here, so here goes nothing: I didn't have the best childhood and come from poverty. The result of some of those early lifehood experiences includes but is not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Anxiety Issues</p>\n<ul>\n<li>general</li>\n<li>Social</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Self Esteem Issues</p>\n<ul>\n<li>susceptible to 'imposter syndrome'</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and that's pretty much it. You know, it's weird, because I feel like the extremes of my childhood are likely one of the reasons that motivate me to try and shoot for success in life. So I'm definitley not asking for any pity here, but I do have difficulty communicating and connecting. People skills have been a muscle that I had to build from nothing, and what's there today is definitley not worth flexing.</p>\n<p>When I started at HP, I didn't really know much, I was just good with technology. Actually, I'm not gonna lie, I had written a few batch scripts, and one time in the ninth grade I wrote a calculcator in python. But I didn't know it was Python, and I didn't know what batch meant. </p>\n<p>My first job was to image servers and run Powershell scripts to configure them.</p>\n<p>That was it. </p>\n<p>As you can imagine, I got bored after a while and began branching out. </p>"}}}},pathContext:{slug:"my-experience-in-web-development"}}}});
